I am going to create a bar chart comparing the critical and audience reception for each Star Wars film, using IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes scores. This visualization will allow me to highlight the differences between critic and fan ratings for each movie in the franchise. I decided to change my chart to something that I would enjoy coding a bit more.
